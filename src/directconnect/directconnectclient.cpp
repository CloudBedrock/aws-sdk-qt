 * @class  DirectConnectClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for AWS Direct Connect
 *
 * AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit
 * Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router.
 * With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon
 * Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
 * (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access
 * to AWS in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a
 * single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US
 * Regions and AWS GovCloud
