 * \class QtAws::DirectConnect::AssociateHostedConnectionRequest
 *
 * \brief The AssociateHostedConnectionRequest class provides an interface for DirectConnect AssociateHostedConnection requests.
 *
 * \ingroup DirectConnect
 *
 *  AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit
 *  Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router.
 *  With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon
 *  Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
 *  (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access
 *  to AWS in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a
 *  single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US
 *  Regions and AWS GovCloud
