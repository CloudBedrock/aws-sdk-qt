 *  <fullname>Amazon ElastiCache</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the
 * 
 *  cloud>
 * 
 *  With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with less of the
 *  administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and
 *  cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache
 * 
 *  deployment>
 * 
 *  In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance
 *  statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs
