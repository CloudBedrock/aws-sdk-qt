 * @class  CodeBuildClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for AWS CodeBuild
 *
 * <fullname>AWS CodeBuild</fullname>
 *
 * AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests,
 * and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your
 * own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build
 * tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use
 * your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests, and you pay only for the build
 * time you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the <i>AWS CodeBuild User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * AWS CodeBuild supports these
 *
 * operations> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>BatchDeleteBuilds</code>: Deletes one or more
 *
 * builds> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>BatchGetProjects</code>: Gets information about one or more build projects. A <i>build project</i> defines how AWS
 * CodeBuild will run a build. This includes information such as where to get the source code to build, the build
 * environment to use, the build commands to run, and where to store the build output. A <i>build environment</i>
 * represents a combination of operating system, programming language runtime, and tools that AWS CodeBuild will use to run
 * a build. Also, you can add tags to build projects to help manage your resources and
 *
 * costs> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>CreateProject</code>: Creates a build
 *
 * project> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>CreateWebhook</code>: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub
 * repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to begin automatically rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed
 * to the
 *
 * repository> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>UpdateWebhook</code>: Changes the settings of an existing
 *
 * webhook> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>DeleteProject</code>: Deletes a build
 *
 * project> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>DeleteWebhook</code>: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub
 * repository, stops AWS CodeBuild from automatically rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the
 *
 * repository> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>ListProjects</code>: Gets a list of build project names, with each build project name representing a single build
 *
 * project> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>UpdateProject</code>: Changes the settings of an existing build
 *
 * project> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>BatchGetBuilds</code>: Gets information about one or more

 *
 * <code>ListBuilds</code>: Gets a list of build IDs, with each build ID representing a single
 *
