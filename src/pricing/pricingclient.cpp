 *
 * @brief  Client for AWS Price List Service ( Pricing)
 *
 * AWS Price List Service API (AWS Price List Service) is a centralized and convenient way to programmatically query Amazon
 * Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The AWS Price List Service uses standardized product
 * attributes such as <code>Location</code>, <code>Storage Class</code>, and <code>Operating System</code>, and provides
 * prices at the SKU level. You can use the AWS Price List Service to build cost control and scenario planning tools,
 * reconcile billing data, forecast future spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit analysis that compare
 * your internal workloads with
 *
 * AWS>
 *
 * Use <code>GetServices</code> without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all AWS services, then
 * <code>GetServices</code> with a service code to retreive the attribute names for that service. After you have the
 * service code and attribute names, you can use <code>GetAttributeValues</code> to see what values are available for an
 * attribute. With the service code and an attribute name and value, you can use <code>GetProducts</code> to find specific
 * products that you're interested in, such as an <code>AmazonEC2</code> instance, with a <code>Provisioned IOPS</code>
 *
 * <code>volumeType</code>>
 *
 * Service
 *
 * Endpoin>
 *
 * AWS Price List Service API provides the following two
 *
 * endpoints> <ul> <li>
 *
 * https://api.pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.co> </li> <li>
