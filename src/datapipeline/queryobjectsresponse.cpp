 *
 * \brief The QueryObjectsResponse class encapsulates DataPipeline QueryObjects responses.
 *
 * \ingroup DataPipeline
 *
 *  AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details
 *  of scheduling and ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus on processing the
 * 
 *  data>
 * 
 *  AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline
 *  Task Runner provides logic for common data management scenarios, such as performing database queries and running data
 *  analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or
 *  you can write your own task runner to provide custom data
 * 
 *  management>
 * 
 *  AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline and define data
 *  sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data. Use the second set in your task runner
 *  application to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for performing the task, such as querying the data,
 *  running data analysis, or converting the data from one format to another, is contained within the task runner. The task
 *  runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When
 *  the task is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web
