 *
 * <fullname>AWS CodeDeploy</fullname> <b>Overview</b>
 *
 * This reference guide provides descriptions of the AWS CodeDeploy APIs. For more information about AWS CodeDeploy, see
 * the <a href="docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide">AWS CodeDeploy User
 *
 * Guide</a>> <b>Using the APIs</b>
 *
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to work with the
 *
 * following> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Applications are unique identifiers used by AWS CodeDeploy to ensure the correct combinations of revisions, deployment
 * configurations, and deployment groups are being referenced during
 *
 * deployments>
 *
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, list, and update
 *
 * applications> </li> <li>
 *
 * Deployment configurations are sets of deployment rules and success and failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during
 *
 * deployments>
 *
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, and list deployment
 *
 * configurations> </li> <li>
 *
 * Deployment groups are groups of instances to which application revisions can be
 *
 * deployed>
 *
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, list, and update deployment
 *
 * groups> </li> <li>
 *
 * Instances represent Amazon EC2 instances to which application revisions are deployed. Instances are identified by their
 * Amazon EC2 tags or Auto Scaling group names. Instances belong to deployment
 *
 * groups>
 *
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get and list
 *
 * instance> </li> <li>
 *
 * Deployments represent the process of deploying revisions to
 *
 * instances>
 *
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, get, list, and stop
 *
 * deployments> </li> <li>
 *
 * Application revisions are archive files stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. These revisions contain
 * source content (such as source code, web pages, executable files, and deployment scripts) along with an application
 * specification (AppSpec) file. (The AppSpec file is unique to AWS CodeDeploy; it defines the deployment actions you want
 * AWS CodeDeploy to execute.) Ffor application revisions stored in Amazon S3 buckets, an application revision is uniquely
 * identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For application revisions stored in GitHub
 * repositories, an application revision is uniquely identified by its repository name and commit ID. Application revisions
 * are deployed through deployment
 *
 * groups>
 *
 * You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get, list, and register application
