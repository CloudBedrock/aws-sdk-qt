 *
 * @brief  Client for Elastic Load Balancing (Elastic Load Balancing v2)
 *
 * <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
 *
 * A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase
 * the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures
 * that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by
 * specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to
 * the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer
 * to the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the
 *
 * targets>
 *
 * Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load
 * Balancers, and Classic Load
 *
 * Balancers>
 *
 * An Application Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS). A Network
 * Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions at the transport layer (TCP). Both Application Load Balancers
 * and Network Load Balancers can route requests to one or more ports on each EC2 instance or container instance in your
 * virtual private cloud
 *
 * (VPC)>
 *
 * A Classic Load Balancer makes routing and load balancing decisions either at the transport layer (TCP/SSL) or the
 * application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), and supports either EC2-Classic or a VPC. For more information, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User
 *
 * Guide</a>>
 *
 * This reference covers the 2015-12-01 API, which supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. The
 * 2012-06-01 API supports Classic Load
 *
 * Balancers>
 *
 * To get started, complete the following
 *
 * tasks> <ol> <li>
 *
 * Create a load balancer using
 *
 * <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>> </li> <li>
 *
 * Create a target group using
 *
 * <a>CreateTargetGroup</a>> </li> <li>
 *
 * Register targets for the target group using
 *
 * <a>RegisterTargets</a>> </li> <li>
 *
 * Create one or more listeners for your load balancer using
 *
 * <a>CreateListener</a>> </li> </ol>
 *
 * To delete a load balancer and its related resources, complete the following
 *
 * tasks> <ol> <li>
 *
 * Delete the load balancer using
 *
 * <a>DeleteLoadBalancer</a>> </li> <li>
 *
 * Delete the target group using
 *
 * <a>DeleteTargetGroup</a>> </li> </ol>
 *
 * All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an
