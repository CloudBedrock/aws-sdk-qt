 *
 * \brief The DeleteClusterResponse class provides an interace for ECS DeleteCluster responses.
 *
 * \ingroup ECS
 *
 *  Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it
 *  easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure
 *  that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you
 *  can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2
 *  launch type. For more information about launch types, see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html">Amazon ECS Launch
 * 
 *  Types</a>>
 * 
 *  Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of
 *  your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2
 * 
 *  features>
 * 
 *  You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 *  isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster
 *  management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management
