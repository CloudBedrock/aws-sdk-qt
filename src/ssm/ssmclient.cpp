/**
 * @class  SsmClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Amazon Simple Systems Management Service ( SSM)
 *
 * Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) enables you to remotely manage the configuration of your Amazon EC2 instances,
 * virtual machines (VMs), or servers in your on-premises environment or in an environment provided by other cloud
 * providers using scripts, commands, or the Amazon EC2 console. SSM includes an on-demand solution called <i>Amazon EC2
 * Run Command</i> and a lightweight instance configuration solution called <i>SSM Config</i>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * This references is intended to be used with the EC2 Run Command User Guide for <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/execute-remote-commands.html">Linux</a> or <a
 *
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/execute-remote-commands.html">Windows</a>> <note>
 *
 * You must register your on-premises servers and VMs through an activation process before you can configure them using Run
 * Command. Registered servers and VMs are called <i>managed instances</i>. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managed-instances.html">Setting Up Run Command On Managed
 * Instances (On-Premises Servers and VMs) on Linux</a> or <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/managed-instances.html">Setting Up Run Command On Managed
 * Instances (On-Premises Servers and VMs) on
 *
 * Windows</a>> </note>
 *
 * <b>Run Command</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Run Command provides an on-demand experience for executing commands. You can use pre-defined SSM documents to perform
 * the actions listed later in this section, or you can create your own documents. With these documents, you can remotely
 * configure your instances by sending commands using the <b>Commands</b> page in the <a
 * href="http://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2 console</a>, <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Amazon_Simple_Systems_Management_cmdlets.html">AWS
 * Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/index.html">AWS
 * CLI</a>, or AWS
 *
 * SDKs>
 *
 * Run Command reports the status of the command execution for each instance targeted by a command. You can also audit the
 * command execution to understand who executed commands, when, and what changes were made. By switching between different
 * SSM documents, you can quickly configure your instances with different types of commands. To get started with Run
 * Command, verify that your environment meets the prerequisites for remotely running commands on EC2 instances (<a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html">Linux</a> or <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html">Windows</a>).
 *
 * </p <p/>
 *
 * <b>SSM Config</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * SSM Config is a lightweight instance configuration solution. SSM Config is currently only available for Windows
 * instances. With SSM Config, you can specify a setup configuration for your instances. SSM Config is similar to EC2 User
 * Data, which is another way of running one-time scripts or applying settings during instance launch. SSM Config is an
 * extension of this capability. Using SSM documents, you can specify which actions the system should perform on your
 * instances, including which applications to install, which AWS Directory Service directory to join, which Microsoft
 * PowerShell modules to install, etc. If an instance is missing one or more of these configurations, the system makes
 * those changes. By default, the system checks every five minutes to see if there is a new configuration to apply as
 * defined in a new SSM document. If so, the system updates the instances accordingly. In this way, you can remotely
 * maintain a consistent configuration baseline on your instances. SSM Config is available using the AWS CLI or the AWS
 * Tools for Windows PowerShell. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-configuration-manage.html">Managing Windows Instance
 *
 * Configuration</a>>
 *
 * SSM Config and Run Command include the following pre-defined
 *
 * documents>
 *
 * <b>Linux</b>
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-RunShellScript</b> to run shell
 *
 * script> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-UpdateSSMAgent</b> to update the Amazon SSM
 *
 * agen> </li> </ul> <p/>
 *
 * <b>Windows</b>
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-JoinDirectoryServiceDomain</b> to join an AWS
 *
 * Director> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-RunPowerShellScript</b> to run PowerShell commands or
 *
 * script> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-UpdateEC2Config</b> to update the EC2Config
 *
 * servic> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-ConfigureWindowsUpdate</b> to configure Windows Update
 *
 * setting> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-InstallApplication</b> to install, repair, or uninstall software using an MSI
 *
 * packag> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-InstallPowerShellModule</b> to install PowerShell modules
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-ConfigureCloudWatch</b> to configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and
 *
 * system> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-ListWindowsInventory</b> to collect information about an EC2 instance running in
 *
 * Windows> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-FindWindowsUpdates</b> to scan an instance and determines which updates are
 *
 * missing> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-InstallMissingWindowsUpdates</b> to install missing updates on your EC2
 *
 * instance> </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>AWS-InstallSpecificWindowsUpdates</b> to install one or more specific
 *
 * updates> </li> </ul> <important>
 *
 * The commands or scripts specified in SSM documents run with administrative privilege on your instances because the
 * Amazon SSM agent runs as root on Linux and the EC2Config service runs in the Local System account on Windows. If a user
 * has permission to execute any of the pre-defined SSM documents (any document that begins with AWS-*) then that user also
 * has administrator access to the instance. Delegate access to Run Command and SSM Config judiciously. This becomes
 * extremely important if you create your own SSM documents. Amazon Web Services does not provide guidance about how to
 * create secure SSM documents. You create SSM documents and delegate access to Run Command at your own risk. As a security
 * best practice, we recommend that you assign access to "AWS-*" documents, especially the AWS-RunShellScript document on
 * Linux and the AWS-RunPowerShellScript document on Windows, to trusted administrators only. You can create SSM documents
 * for specific tasks and delegate access to
 *
 * non-administrators> </important>
