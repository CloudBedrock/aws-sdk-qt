 *
 * AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system
 * inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and
 * configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the
 * configuration of your managed instances. A <i>managed instance</i> is any Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises machine in
 * your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems
 *
 * Manager>

/**
 * Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents,
 * managed instances, Maintenance Windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize
 * your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an
 * optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed
 * instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin,
 * SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or

 *
 * Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of
 * tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you
