 * @brief  Client for AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane
 *
 * AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote operations that are sent to and executed on
 * one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to download
 * and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting
 *
 * operations>
 *
 * To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be performed, and you
 * specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or
 *
 * both>
 *
 * AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the execution of the job
 * by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs
 * service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the targets of the
