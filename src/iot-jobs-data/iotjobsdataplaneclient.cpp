 * \ingroup IoTJobsDataPlane
 *
 *  AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote operations that are sent to and executed on
 *  one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to download
 *  and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting
 * 
 *  operations>
 * 
 *  To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be performed, and you
 *  specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or
 * 
 *  both>
 * 
 *  AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the execution of the job
 *  by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs
 *  service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the targets of the
