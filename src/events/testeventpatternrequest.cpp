 *
 * \brief The TestEventPatternRequest class provides an interface for CloudWatchEvents TestEventPattern requests.
 *
 * \ingroup CloudWatchEvents
 *
 *  Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state,
 *  they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and
 *  route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example,
 *  you can configure rules
 * 
 *  to> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 *  enters the running
 * 
 *  state> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream for detailed analysis of potential security or
 *  availability
 * 
 *  risks> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
 * 
 *  volume> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the <a
