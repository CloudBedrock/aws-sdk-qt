 * @class  ApplicationDiscoveryServiceClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for AWS Application Discovery Service
 *
 * <fullname>AWS Application Discovery Service</fullname>
 *
 * AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects by automatically identifying servers,
 * virtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies running in your on-premises data centers. Application
 * Discovery Service also collects application performance data, which can help you assess the outcome of your migration.
 * The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely retained in an AWS-hosted and managed database in the
 * cloud. You can export the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration solution
 * to plan your migration. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">AWS
 * Application Discovery Service
 *
 * FAQ</a>>
 *
 * Application Discovery Service offers two modes of
 *
 * operation> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <b>Agentless discovery</b> mode is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't
 * require you to install an agent on each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating
 * systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery
 * doesn't collect information about software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments.
 *
 * </p </li> <li>
 *
 * <b>Agent-based discovery</b> mode collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application
 * Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure and
 * application information, including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process performance,
 * resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads. The information collected by agents is secured at rest
 * and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments and to collect information about software
 * and software dependencies. You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery
 * to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then install agents on select
 *
 * hosts>
 *
 * Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner Network (APN) partners.
 * Third-party application discovery tools can query Application Discovery Service and write to the Application Discovery
 * Service database using a public API. You can then import the data into either a visualization tool or cloud-migration
 *
 * solution> <b>
 *
 * Application Discovery Service doesn't gather sensitive information. All data is handled according to the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>. You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to
 * inspect collected data before it is shared with the
 *
 * service> </b>
 *
 * Your AWS account must be granted access to Application Discovery Service, a process called <i>whitelisting</i>. This is
 * true for AWS partners and customers alike. To request access, <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/">sign up for Application Discovery Service</a>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for
 * Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.
 * Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform
 * that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS
 *
 * SDKs</a>>
