/**
 * @class  LightsailClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Amazon Lightsail
 *
 * Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers.
 * Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data
 * transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail servers through the
 * Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface
 *
 * (CLI)>
 *
 * For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a
 * href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all">Lightsail Dev
 *
 * Guide</a>>
 *
 * To use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to generate access
 * keys. For details about how to set this up, see the <a
 * href="http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli">Lightsail
