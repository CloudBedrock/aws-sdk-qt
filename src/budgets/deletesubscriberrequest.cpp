 *
 * \brief The DeleteSubscriberRequest class provides an interface for Budgets DeleteSubscriber requests.
 *
 * \ingroup Budgets
 *
 *  Budgets enable you to plan your service usage, service costs, and your RI utilization. You can also track how close your
 *  plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits. Budgets provide you with a quick way to see your
 *  usage-to-date and current estimated charges from AWS and to see how much your predicted usage accrues in charges by the
 *  end of the month. Budgets also compare current estimates and charges to the amount that you indicated you want to use or
 *  spend and lets you see how much of your budget has been used. AWS updates your budget status several times a day.
 *  Budgets track your unblended costs, subscriptions, and refunds. You can create the following types of
 * 
 *  budgets> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Cost budgets allow you to say how much you want to spend on a
 * 
 *  service> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Usage budgets allow you to say how many hours you want to use for one or more
 * 
 *  services> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  RI utilization budgets allow you to define a utilization threshold and receive alerts when RIs are tracking below that
 * 
 *  threshold> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  You can create up to 20,000 budgets per AWS master account. Your first two budgets are free of charge. Each additional
 *  budget costs $0.02 per day. You can set up optional notifications that warn you if you exceed, or are forecasted to
 *  exceed, your budgeted amount. You can have notifications sent to an Amazon SNS topic, to an email address, or to both.
 *  For more information, see <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-sns-policy.html">Creating an Amazon SNS Topic
