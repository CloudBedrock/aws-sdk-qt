 * @class  ElasticLoadBalancingClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Elastic Load Balancing
 *
 * <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
 *
 * A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability
 * of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes
 * traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more
 * listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer and a
 * protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the
 *
 * instances>
 *
 * Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and
 * Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more information, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User
 *
 * Guide</a>>
 *
 * This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load Balancers. The 2015-12-01 API supports Application
 * Load Balancers and Network Load
 *
 * Balancers>
 *
 * To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>. Register your
 * instances with the load balancer using
 *
 * <a>RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer</a>>
 *
 * All Elastic Load Balancing operations are <i>idempotent</i>, which means that they complete at most one time. If you
 * repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK response
