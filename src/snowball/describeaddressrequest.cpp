 *
 * \ingroup Snowball
 *
 *  AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data
 *  between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands described
 *  here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables
 *  you to create and manage jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball appliance, you'll need to use the
 *  Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information, see the <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
