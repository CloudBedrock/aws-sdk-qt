 *
 * AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data
 * between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands described
 * here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables
 * you to create and manage jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball appliance, you'll need to use the
 * Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
