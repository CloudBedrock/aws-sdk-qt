 * 
 *  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled
 *  applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers
 *  over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see <a
 *  href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">http://aws.amazon.com/sns</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and
 *  their associated API calls, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain
 *  functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying
 *  requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools
 *  for Amazon Web Services</a>.
