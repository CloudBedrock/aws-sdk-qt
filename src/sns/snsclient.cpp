/**
 * @class  SnsClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Amazon Simple Notification Service ( SNS)
 *
 * <fullname>Amazon Simple Notification Service</fullname>
 *
 * Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled
 * applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers
 * over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">http://aws.amazon.com/sns</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and
 * their associated API calls, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain
 * functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying
 * requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools
 * for Amazon Web Services</a>.
