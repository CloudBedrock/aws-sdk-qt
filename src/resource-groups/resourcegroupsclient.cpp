 * @brief  Client for AWS Resource Groups
 *
 * <fullname>AWS Resource Groups</fullname>
 *
 * AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
 * databases, and Amazon S3 buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection of
 * resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can
 * create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions, application
 * layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in AWS Systems
 * Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you
 * quickly view a custom console in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring data about
 * member
 *
 * resources>
 *
 * To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that identify the criteria that members of the
 * group have in common. Tags are key-value
 *
 * pairs>
 *
 * For more information about Resource Groups, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS Resource Groups User
 *
 * Guide</a>>
 *
 * AWS Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the following types of
 *
 * operations> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and resource query
 *
 * entitie> </li> <li>
 *
 * Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource
 *
 * group> </li> <li>
 *
 * Resolving resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as search
 *
 * result> </li> <li>
 *
 * Getting data about resources that are members of a
 *
 * grou> </li> <li>
 *
 * Searching AWS resources based on a resource
