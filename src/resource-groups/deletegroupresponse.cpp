 *
 * \brief The DeleteGroupResponse class encapsulates ResourceGroups DeleteGroup responses.
 *
 * \ingroup ResourceGroups
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Resource Groups</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
 *  databases, and Amazon S3 buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection of
 *  resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can
 *  create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions, application
 *  layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in AWS Systems
 *  Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you
 *  quickly view a custom console in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring data about
 *  member
 * 
 *  resources>
 * 
 *  To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that identify the criteria that members of the
 *  group have in common. Tags are key-value
 * 
 *  pairs>
 * 
 *  For more information about Resource Groups, see the <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS Resource Groups User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
