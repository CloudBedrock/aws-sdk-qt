This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data types for AWS CodeCommit API.</p> <p>You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:</p> <ul> <li>Repositories, by calling the following: <ul> <li><a>BatchGetRepositories</a>, which returns information about one or more repositories associated with your AWS account</li> <li><a>CreateRepository</a>, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository</li> <li><a>DeleteRepository</a>, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository</li> <li><a>GetRepository</a>, which returns information about a specified repository</li> <li><a>ListRepositories</a>, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories associated with your AWS account</li> <li><a>UpdateRepositoryDescription</a>, which sets or updates the description of the repository</li> <li><a>UpdateRepositoryName</a>, which changes the name of the repository. If you change the name of a repository, no other users of that repository will be able to access it until you send them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.</li> </ul></li> <li>Branches, by calling the following: <ul> <li><a>CreateBranch</a>, which creates a new branch in a specified repository</li> <li><a>GetBranch</a>, which returns information about a specified branch</li> <li><a>ListBranches</a>, which lists all branches for a specified repository</li> <li><a>UpdateDefaultBranch</a>, which changes the default branch for a repository</li> </ul></li> <li>Information about committed code in a repository, by calling the following: <ul> <li><a>GetCommit</a>, which returns information about a commit, including commit messages and committer information.</li> </ul></li> <li>Triggers, by calling the following: <ul> <li><a>GetRepositoryTriggers</a>, which returns information about triggers configured for a repository</li> <li><a>PutRepositoryTriggers</a>, which replaces all triggers for a repository and can be used to create or delete triggers</li> <li><a>TestRepositoryTriggers</a>, which tests the functionality of a repository trigger by sending data to the trigger target</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For information about how to use AWS CodeCommit, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodeCommit User Guide</a>.</p>
