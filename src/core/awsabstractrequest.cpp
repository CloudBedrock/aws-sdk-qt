 * \class QtAws::Core::AwsAbstractRequest
 * \brief The AwsAbstractRequest class provides an interface for AWS requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsCore
 *
 * Typically, a user would pass a derived class (such as SqsCreateQueueRequest)
 * to an AwsAbstractClient-derived class (such as SqsClient) to send a request
 * to an AWS service.
 *
 * Note, by design, requests based on this class are endpoint-agnostic.  That is,
 * you may instantiate a request (such as an SqsCreateQueueRequest), and pass it
 * to multiple clients (such as a US instance of SqsClient as well as an AU
 * instance of SqsClient).  Thus it is the caller (typically an
 * AwsAbstractClient-derived class) that is responsible for for setting the
 * region / endpoint information, allowing requests to be reused unmodified
 * multiple times, and/or in multiple regions.
