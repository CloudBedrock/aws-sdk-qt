 * @class  AwsSignatureV1
 *
 * @brief  Implements AWS Signature Version 1 \ref deprecated "(deprecated by Amazon)"
 *
 * @deprecated  Amazon has officially deprecated signature Version 1 in favor of later,
 *              more secure signatures, such as AwsSignatureV2 and AwsSignatureV4.
 *
 * As version 1 signatures are rightly regarded as *insecure*, this class will refuse to sign
 * requests that use insecure transports such as HTTP instead of HTTPS. However, insecure
 * signatures can be enabled (why would you want to?) by defining `ALLOW_INSECURE_V1_SIGNATURES`
 * when compiling this library.
 *
 * @see  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html
 * @see  http://lmgtfy.com/?q=aws+signature+version+1+is+insecure
