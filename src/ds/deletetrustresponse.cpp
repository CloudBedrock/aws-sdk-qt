 *  AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or
 *  connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed
 *  information about AWS Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about AWS
 *  Directory Services features, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">AWS Directory Service</a> and the <a

 *  Guide</a>> <note>
 * 
 *  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby,
 *  .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Directory Service and
 *  other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
