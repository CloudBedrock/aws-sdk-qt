 * @class  ConfigServiceClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for AWS Config (Config Service)
 *
 * <fullname>AWS Config</fullname>
 *
 * AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the AWS resources associated with your AWS account.
 * You can use AWS Config to get the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also to get information
 * about the relationship between the resources. An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an
 * Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of
 * resources currently supported by AWS Config, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported
 * AWS
 *
 * Resources</a>>
 *
 * You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the
 * AWS Config API, or the AWS SDKs for AWS Config. This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API and
 * the AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for
 * signing requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.
 * For detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated actions or commands, as well as how to work with
 * AWS Management Console, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html">What Is
 * AWS Config</a> in the <i>AWS Config Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>> <ul> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> <li/> </ul> <ul> <li/>
