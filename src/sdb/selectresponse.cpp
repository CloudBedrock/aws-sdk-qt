 *
 * \brief The SelectResponse class encapsulates SimpleDB Select responses.
 *
 * \ingroup SimpleDB
 *
 *  Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By
 *  offloading the time and effort associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides developers
 *  the freedom to focus on application development.
 * 
 *  A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is complex to design, and often
 *  requires extensive and repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring no schema,
 *  automatically indexing your data and providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the
 *  administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning. Developers gain access to this
 *  functionality within Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what they use.
 *
