 *
 * You can create a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">launch
 * template</a>, which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using
 * <a>RunInstances</a>, you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch
 *
 * parameters>
 *
 * To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate
 * launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500
 *
 * instances>
 *
 * An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the <code>running</code> state. You can check the state of your
 * instance using <a>DescribeInstances</a>. You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For
 * more information, see <a>CreateTags</a> and <a

 *
 * Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to
 * the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more
