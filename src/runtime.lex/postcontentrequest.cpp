 * \class QtAws::LexRuntimeService::PostContentRequest
 *
 * \brief The PostContentRequest class provides an interface for LexRuntimeService PostContent requests.
 *
 * \ingroup LexRuntimeService
 *
 *  Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides a set of operations (API). Your
 *  conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose a
 *  user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the
 *  user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user
 *  conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust type), and
 *  then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create
 *  and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API, .
