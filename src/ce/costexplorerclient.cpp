 * For example, AWS automatically aggregates your EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon)
 * Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends
 * the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows
 * the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI
 * recommendation would be for <code>c4.large</code>, because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance
