 * 
 *  AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators,
 *  embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate
 *  with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources associated with each
 *  thing (Thing Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate
 * 
 *  things>
