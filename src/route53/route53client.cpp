 * Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains authoritative DNS information for a specified domain

 * that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of
 *
 * 192.0.2.44>
 *
 * <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body
 * contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When
 * using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of the changes in
 * a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the
 * resource record sets in a hosted zone.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For example, a change batch request that deletes the <code>CNAME</code> record for www.example.com and creates an alias
 * resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second
 * resource record set in a single operation. If either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails,
 * then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to
 *
 * exist> <b>
 *
 * Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete the same resource record set more than once in a single
 * change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an
 * <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code>
 *
 * error> </b>
 *
 * <b>Traffic Flow</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the
 * Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as
 * a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain
 * names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if
 * the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html">Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS
 * Traffic</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * <b>Create, Delete, and Upsert</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Use <code>ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest</code> to perform the following
 *
 * actions> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>CREATE</code>: Creates a resource record set that has the specified
 *
 * values> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>DELETE</code>: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified
 *
 * values> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>UPSERT</code>: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS creates it. If a resource set does exist,
 * Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as
 * weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For an example for each type of resource record set, see
 *
 * "Examples.>
 *
 * Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of
 * resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * <b>Change Propagation to Amazon Route 53 DNS Servers</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * When you submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Amazon Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the
 * Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status
 * of <code>PENDING</code>. When propagation is complete, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>INSYNC</code>.
 * Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see
 *
 * <a>GetChange</a>>
