 * @brief  Client for AWS OpsWorks
 *
 * <fullname>AWS OpsWorks</fullname>
 *
 + Welcome to the <i>AWS OpsWorks API Reference</i>. This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for AWS OpsWorks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes.
 *
 + AWS OpsWorks is an application management service that provides an integrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle. For information about this product, go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/">AWS OpsWorks</a> details page.
 *
 +  <b>SDKs and CLI</b>
 *
 + The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks API is by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:

 *
 +  <b>Endpoints</b>
 *
 + AWS OpsWorks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Stacks can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.
 *
 +  <ul> <li>
 *
 + opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
 *
 +  </li> <li>
 *
 + opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
 *
 +  </li> <li>
 *
 + opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
 *
 +  </li> <li>
 *
 + opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
 *
 +  </li> <li>
 *
 + opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
 *
 +  </li> <li>
 *
 + opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
 *

 *
 +  </li> <li>
 *
 + opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com
 *
 +  </li> </ul>
 *
 +  <b>Chef Versions</b>
 *
 + When you call <a>CreateStack</a>, <a>CloneStack</a>, or <a>UpdateStack</a> we recommend you use the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html">Chef Versions</a>.
 *
 +  <note>
 *
 + You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as possible.
 *
 +  </note>
