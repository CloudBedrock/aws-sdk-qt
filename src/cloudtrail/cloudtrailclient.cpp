 *
 * This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common
 * errors for
 *
 * CloudTrail>
 *
 * CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
 * bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP
 * address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the
 *
 * service> <note>
 *
 * As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
 * programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create
 * programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing
 * errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
 * them, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services
 *
 * page</a>> </note>
 *
 * See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in the log
