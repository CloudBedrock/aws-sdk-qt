 * @brief  Client for AWS Resource Groups Tagging API
 *
 * <fullname>Resource Groups Tagging API</fullname>
 *
 * This guide describes the API operations for the resource groups
 *
 * tagging>
 *
 * A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define. For
 * example, if you have two Amazon EC2 instances, you might assign both a tag key of "Stack." But the value of "Stack"
 * might be "Testing" for one and "Production" for the
 *
 * other>
 *
 * Tagging can help you organize your resources and enables you to simplify resource management, access management and cost
 * allocation. For more information about tagging, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html">Working with Tag Editor</a> and <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/resource-groups.html">Working with Resource Groups</a>.
 * For more information about permissions you need to use the resource groups tagging APIs, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-resource-groups.html">Obtaining
 * Permissions for Resource Groups </a> and <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-tagging.html">Obtaining
 * Permissions for Tagging
 *
 * </a>>
 *
 * You can use the resource groups tagging APIs to complete the following
 *
 * tasks> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified region for the AWS
 *
 * accoun> </li> <li>
 *
 * Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the specified region for the AWS
 *
 * accoun> </li> <li>
 *
 * List all existing tag keys in the specified region for the AWS
 *
 * accoun> </li> <li>
 *
 * List all existing values for the specified key in the specified region for the AWS
 *
 * accoun> </li> </ul>
 *
 * Not all resources can have tags. For a lists of resources that you can tag, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/supported-resources.html">Supported Resources</a> in the
 * <i>AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * To make full use of the resource groups tagging APIs, you might need additional IAM permissions, including permission to
 * access the resources of individual services as well as permission to view and apply tags to those resources. For more
 * information, see <a
