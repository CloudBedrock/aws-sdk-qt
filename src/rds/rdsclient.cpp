 * @brief  Client for Amazon Relational Database Service ( RDS)
 *
 * <fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname>
 *
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a
 * relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational
 * database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their
 * applications and businesses
 *
 * unique>
 *
 * Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon
 * Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your
 * existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and
 * maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database
 * instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services,
 * there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you
 *
 * use>
 *
 * This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use
 * to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
 * such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter
 * descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance
 * window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user
