 * @brief  Client for Amazon Relational Database Service ( RDS)
 *
 * <fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname>
 *
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a
 * relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational
 * database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their
 * applications and businesses
 *
 * unique>
 *
 * Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon
 * Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your
 * existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and
 * maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's
 * compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no
 * up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you
 *
 * use>
 *
 * This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use
 * to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
 * such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter
 * descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance
 * window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user
 *

/**
 * Copies a snapshot of a DB
 *
 * cluster>
 *
 * To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code>
 * must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster
 *
 * snapshot>
 *
 * You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region. In that case, the AWS Region where you call the
 * <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action is the destination AWS Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be
 * copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region, you must provide the following
 *
 * values> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The AWS Key Management System (AWS KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of
 * the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS
 *
 * Region> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>PreSignedUrl</code> - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the
 * <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action to be called in the source AWS Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied
 * from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> API action that can be
 * executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be
 *
 * copied>
 *
 * The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter
 *
 * values> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the
 * destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action that is
 * called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed
 *
 * URL> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>DestinationRegion</code> - The name of the AWS Region that the DB cluster snapshot will be created
 *
 * in> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster
 * snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For
 * example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your
 * <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> looks like the following example:
 *
 * <code>arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115</code>> </li> </ul>
 *
 * To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html"> Authenticating Requests: Using Query
 * Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4)</a> and <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"> Signature Version 4 Signing
 *
 * Process</a>> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the
 * destination AWS
 *
 * Region> </li> <li>
 *
 * <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster
 * snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source AWS Region and is the same value as the
 * <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> in the pre-signed URL.
 *
 * </p </li> </ul>
 *
 * To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by
 * <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying"
 *
 * status>
