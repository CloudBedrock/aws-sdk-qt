 * \class QtAws::WorkDocs::AddResourcePermissionsRequest
 *
 * \brief The AddResourcePermissionsRequest class encapsulates WorkDocs AddResourcePermissions requests.
 *
 * \ingroup WorkDocs
 *
 *  The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use
 * 
 *  cases> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users who want to migrate their files from an on-premises
 *  or off-premises file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well as allow for
 *  basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of
 * 
 *  files> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional security needs, such as antivirus or
 *  data loss prevention. The API actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur
 *  in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file
 *  violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the
 * 
 *  user> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These
 *  applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail, to
 *  replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical
 * 
 *  applications> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the
 *  AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
 *  policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full
 *  administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not
 *  limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform
 *  the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM
