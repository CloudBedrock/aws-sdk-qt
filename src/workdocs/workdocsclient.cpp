/**
 * @class  WorkDocsClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Amazon WorkDocs
 *
 * The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use
 *
 * cases> <ul> <li>
 *
 * File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users who want to migrate their files from an on-premises
 * or off-premises file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well as allow for
 * basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of
 *
 * files> </li> <li>
 *
 * Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional security needs, such as antivirus or
 * data loss prevention. The API actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur
 * in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file
 * violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the
 *
 * user> </li> <li>
 *
 * eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These
 * applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail, to
 * replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical
 *
 * applications> </li> </ul>
 *
 * All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the
 * AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
 * policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full
 * administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not
 * limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform
 * the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM
