 * \ingroup Glacier
 *
 *  Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for "cold
 * 
 *  data.>
 * 
 *  Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data
 *  backup and archival. With Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades.
 *  Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so
 *  they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and
 *  recovery, or time-consuming hardware
 * 
 *  migrations>
 * 
 *  Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and
 *  retrieval latency of several hours is acceptable. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data,
 *  consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service
 *  (Amazon
 * 
 *  S3)</a>>
 * 
 *  You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in
 *  Amazon
 * 
 *  Glacier>
 * 
 *  If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the

 *  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html">What is Amazon Glacier</a> - This
