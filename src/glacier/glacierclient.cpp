 * @class  GlacierClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Amazon Glacier
 *
 * Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for "cold
 *
 * data.>
 *
 * Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data
 * backup and archival. With Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades.
 * Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so
 * they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and
 * recovery, or time-consuming hardware
 *
 * migrations>
 *
 * Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and
 * retrieval latency of several hours is acceptable. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data,
 * consider using Amazon S3. For more information, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service
 * (Amazon
 *
 * S3)</a>>
 *
 * You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in
 * Amazon Glacier.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the
 * <i>Amazon Glacier Developer
 *
 * Guide</i>> <ul> <li><p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html">What is Amazon
 * Glacier</a> - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and
 * the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.</p></li> <li><p><a
