 * \class QtAws::Redshift::DescribeEventsRequest
 *
 * \brief The DescribeEventsRequest class encapsulates Redshift DescribeEvents requests.
 *
 * \ingroup Redshift
 *
 *  <fullname>Amazon Redshift</fullname>
 * 
 *  <b>Overview</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line
 *  interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that
 *  some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command
 *  has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the
 *  next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management
 *  interfaces, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html">Using the Amazon Redshift
 *  Management
 * 
 *  Interfaces</a>>
 * 
 *  Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity,
 *  monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on
 *  using your data to acquire new insights for your business and
 * 
 *  customers>
 * 
 *  If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html">Amazon Redshift Getting Started
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  If you are a database developer, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html">Amazon
 *  Redshift Database Developer Guide</a> explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your
 *  data warehouse.
