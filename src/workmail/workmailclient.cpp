 * @class  WorkMailClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Amazon WorkMail
 *
 * Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for existing desktop and mobile
 * email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or their native
 * iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control
 * both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is
 *
 * stored>
 *
 * The Amazon WorkMail API is designed for the following
 *
 * scenarios> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Listing and describing
 *
 * organization> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Managing
 *
 * user> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Managing
 *
 * group> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>
 *
 * Managing
 *
 * resource> </li> </ul>
 *
 * All Amazon WorkMail API actions are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the
 * AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
 * policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full
 * administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but
 * is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This allows developers to
 * perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM
