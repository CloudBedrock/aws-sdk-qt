 *  <fullname>AWS CloudFormation</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can
 *  use AWS CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store,
 *  Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable,
 *  cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS
 * 
 *  infrastructure>
 * 
 *  With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a
 *  collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of
 *  the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for
 * 
 *  you>
