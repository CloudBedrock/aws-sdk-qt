 * @brief  Client for AWS CloudFormation
 *
 * <fullname>AWS CloudFormation</fullname>
 *
 + AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective applications without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.
 *
 + With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.
 *
 + For more information about this product, go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation Product Page</a>.
 *
 + Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/</a>.
