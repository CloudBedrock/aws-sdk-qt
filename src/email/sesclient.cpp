 * creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES
 *
 * provides> </li> <li>
 *
 * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to
 * specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can
 * pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or

 * <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code>

 *
 * </p </li> </ul> <b>
 *
 * Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature; Amazon SES will remove them before sending the

 *
 * For most common sending authorization scenarios, we recommend that you specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code>
 * parameter and not the <code>FromIdentityArn</code> or <code>ReturnPathIdentityArn</code> parameters. If you only specify
 * the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter, Amazon SES will set the From and Return Path addresses to the identity
 * specified in <code>SourceIdentityArn</code>. For more information about sending authorization, see the <a
