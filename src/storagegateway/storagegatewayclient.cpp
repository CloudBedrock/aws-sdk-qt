 * @brief  Client for AWS Storage Gateway
 *
 * <fullname>AWS Storage Gateway Service</fullname>
 *
 * AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide
 * seamless and secure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure.
 * The service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster
 *
 * recovery>
 *
 * Use the following links to get started using the <i>AWS Storage Gateway Service API
 *
 * Reference</i>> <ul> <li>
 *
 * <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders">AWS

 *
 * </p </li> </ul> <note>
 *
 * AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects
 * resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in
 * Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be <code>vol-AA22BB012345DAF670</code>. When you use this ID with the EC2 API,
 * you must change it to <code>vol-aa22bb012345daf670</code>. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as
 *
 * expected> </note> <b>
 *
 * IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format.
 * Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April
 * 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more information,
 * see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2 and EBS Resource
 *
 * IDs</a>>
 *
 * For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format looks like the
 *
 * following>
 *
 *
 * <code>arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG</code>>
 *
 * A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following:
 *
 * <code>snap-78e226633445566ee</code>>
 *
 * For more information, see <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=3557">Announcement: Heads-up â€“ Longer
