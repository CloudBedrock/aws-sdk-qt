 *
 *  DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX dramatically speeds up database reads by caching
 *  frequently-accessed data from DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-millisecond latency. You can
 *  create a DAX cluster easily, using the AWS Management Console. With a few simple modifications to your code, your
 *  application can begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster and realize significant improvements in read
