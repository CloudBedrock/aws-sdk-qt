/**
 * @class  AthenaClient
 *
 * @brief  Client for Amazon Athena
 *
 * Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You
 * can point Athena at your data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so
 * there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales
 * automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more
 * information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">What is Amazon Athena</a> in the
 * <i>Amazon Athena User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * For code samples using the AWS SDK for Java, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/code-samples.html">Examples and Code Samples</a> in the <i>Amazon
 * Athena User
