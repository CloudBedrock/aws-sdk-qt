 * \brief The StartQueryExecutionRequest class encapsulates Athena StartQueryExecution requests.
 *
 * \ingroup Athena
 *
 *  Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You
 *  can point Athena at your data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so
 *  there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales
 *  automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more
 *  information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">What is Amazon Athena</a> in the
 *  <i>Amazon Athena User
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  For code samples using the AWS SDK for Java, see <a
