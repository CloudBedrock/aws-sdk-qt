 *
 * <fullname>AWS Step Functions</fullname>
 *
 * AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices
 * using visual
 *
 * workflows>
 *
 * You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs a discrete function,
 * or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
 * visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each
 * step, and retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right order every
 * time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any
 *
 * issues>
 *
 * Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is available at any scale.
 * You can run tasks on AWS, your own servers, or any system that has access to AWS. You can access and use Step Functions
 * using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the <i> <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html">AWS Step Functions Developer Guide</a>
