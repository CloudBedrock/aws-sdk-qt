 *
 * @brief  Client for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 *
 * <fullname>AWS Identity and Access Management</fullname>
 *
 * AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can use to manage users and user permissions under
 * your AWS account. This guide provides descriptions of IAM actions that you can call programmatically. For general
 * information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>. For the
 * user guide for IAM, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Using IAM</a>.
 *
 * </p <note>
 *
 * AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby,
 * .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM and AWS. For example,
 * the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying
 * requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a> page.
 *
 * </p </note>
 *
 * We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query
 * API to make direct calls to the IAM web service. To learn more about the IAM Query API, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making Query Requests</a> in the <i>Using
 * IAM</i> guide. IAM supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for
 * some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for
 * operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * <b>Signing Requests</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your
 * AWS account access key ID and secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access key ID and secret
 * access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials and
 * use those to sign
 *
 * requests>
 *
 * To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>. If you have an
 * existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However,
 * some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate this
 * requirement.
 *
 * </p
