 * \class QtAws::CodePipeline::DeleteCustomActionTypeResponse
 * \brief The DeleteCustomActionTypeResponse class provides an interace for CodePipeline DeleteCustomActionType responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsCodePipeline
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS CodePipeline</fullname>
 * 
 *  <b>Overview</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS
 *  CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline is only configurable through the API. For additional information, see
 *  the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodePipeline User
 * 
 *  Guide</a>>
 * 
 *  You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, gates, and transitions, as described
 * 
 *  below>
 * 
 *  <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of actions,
 *  gates, and stages.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  You can work with pipelines by
 * 
 *  calling> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely-named
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline
 *  Amazon Resource Name
 * 
 *  (ARN)> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns information about a specific execution of a
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your
 * 
 *  account> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the the most recent revision of an artifact through the
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  Pipelines include <i>stages</i>, which are logical groupings of gates and actions. Each stage contains one or more
 *  actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage will result in success or failure. If a stage fails,
 *  then the pipeline stops at that stage and will remain stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the
 *  source location, or a user takes action to re-run the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call
 *  <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or
 *  <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more
 *  information about the structure of stages and actions, also refer to the <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html">AWS CodePipeline Pipeline
 *  Structure
 * 
 *  Reference</a>>
 * 
 *  Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i>, which are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed
 *  within a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source
 *  such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with
 *  actions when working with pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and <a>GetPipelineState</a>.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a
 *  pipeline after the actions in one stage
 * 
 *  complete>
 * 
 *  You can work with transitions by
 * 
 *  calling> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a
 * 
 *  pipeline> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.
 * 
 *  </p </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected
 *  sequence varies from the standard API user. In order to integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers will need to work
 *  with the following
 * 
 *  items>
 * 
 *  <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an
 *  artifact from a source.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  You can work with jobs by
 * 
 *  calling> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified
 * 
 *  job> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns the details of a
 * 
 *  job> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>PollForJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act upon,
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure,
 * 
 *  an> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job
 * 
 *  success> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS
 *  CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner
 * 
 *  Network>
 * 
 *  You can work with third party jobs by
 * 
 *  calling> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified
 * 
 *  job> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job for a partner
 * 
 *  action> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act upon,
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure,
 * 
 *  an> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job
