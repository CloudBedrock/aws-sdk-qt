## QtAws Changelog

### 0.3.0 (_unreleased_)
Initial release with broad implementation based on code-generation from
API descriptions.

### 0.2.0 (2016-09-02)
This release, with only partial SQS support, is likely to be the last
release before a pretty major restructure, to switch to auto-generating
most of the code from an API description.

### 0.1.0 (2015-06-16)
Initial release with complete support for AWS endpoint and region classes,
as well as all AWS signature version implementations (versions 0 to 4).
