Libqtaws-codegen is part of the [libqtaws] project.  Specifically, This
`codegen` branch contains a simple application that is used to automate the
generation of a number of the [libqtaws] classes from a set of API descriptions.

## Requirements

While the [libqtaws] library aims to support with all versions of Qt from Qt
5.1 onwards, with or without C++11 support, this code generator only endeavors
to supports the latest stable Qt release, and requires C++11 support.

But other than a recent version of Qt, and a decent modern C++ compiler, this
code generator has no special requirements.

## License

While the [libqtaws] library is made available under the LGPL, this code
generator is released under the GPL.
